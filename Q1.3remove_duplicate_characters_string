1.3 Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer. NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine. An extra copy of the array is not.

Write the test cases for this method.


def remove_dup(word):
    for i, c in enumerate(word):
        if c in word[i+1:]:
            word1=word[:i+1]
            word2= word[i+1:]
            word = word1 +  word2.replace(c," ")
    return word.replace(" ","")

print remove_dup('llllllllllllllllaaatttttttttttttikaaaaaaaaa')
print remove_dup('llllllllllllllll')
print remove_dup('llllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaa')
print remove_dup('general')
