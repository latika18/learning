# Question :Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
#By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, â€¦
#By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
