Question:
I just found a whole bunch of plane tickets that only have a start and destination on them. I also know the route started in a certain city. 
I would like to recover the (alphabetically) first possible route a person took using these tickets. I added some examples in the doctests.

from collections import OrderedDict, defaultdict
